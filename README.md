# Exercise of SICP in Elixir

SICP is the short form of Structure and Interpretation of Computer
Program. SICP is hard, doing it in Elixir is even more challenging as they have
different implementation of language features. Hence, hereby I share my
solution for the SICP exercises and examples I have attempted in Elixir.

### Organization

The repository will be organize based on the chapters. Each chapters is in it
own respective folder.

The naming of some source codes in the first chapter is a bit messy. It is named based on the example title instead of chapter numbers.

Later on, all the naming has the following prefix followed by chapter numbers or exercise numbers:

- Exercise - Prefix with `ex`
- Chapter Example - Prefix with `ch`

### Warning

- There is a lot of redundant code, as I didn't modularized the commonly used
code while doing the exercise, and just simple copy and paste to new files.
It's definitely not the best practice and I am aware of it.
- The solutions are not guranteed to be correct or optimized.
